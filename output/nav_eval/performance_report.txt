===== Key Observations =====
1. EKF vs KF:
   - Longitude error reduced by 80.3% (from 0.245m to 0.048m)
   - Altitude error reduced by 78.1% (from 0.067m to 0.015m)

2. UKF vs KF:
   - Longitude error reduced by 80.8% (from 0.245m to 0.047m)
   - Altitude error reduced by 78.0% (from 0.067m to 0.015m)

3. EKF+RTS vs KF:
   - Latitude error reduced by 71.9% (from 0.046m to 0.013m)
   - Longitude error reduced by 91.9% (from 0.245m to 0.020m)
   - Altitude error reduced by 90.2% (from 0.067m to 0.007m)

4. UKF+RTS vs KF:
   - Latitude error reduced by 71.9% (from 0.046m to 0.013m)
   - Longitude error reduced by 91.9% (from 0.245m to 0.020m)
   - Altitude error reduced by 90.7% (from 0.067m to 0.006m)

5. EKF+RTS vs EKF:
   - Latitude error reduced by 71.2% (from 0.045m to 0.013m)
   - Altitude error reduced by 55.1% (from 0.015m to 0.007m)
   - Pitch error increased by 228.7% (from 0.000080° to 0.000263°)

6. UKF+RTS vs UKF:
   - Latitude error reduced by 69.5% (from 0.042m to 0.013m)
   - Altitude error reduced by 57.8% (from 0.015m to 0.006m)
   - Pitch error increased by 202.4% (from 0.000085° to 0.000257°)

7. Overall Performance Assessment:
   - Both EKF+RTS and UKF+RTS achieve centimeter-level accuracy in all position metrics.
   - The largest relative gains remain on longitude error (e.g., KF: 0.245m → EKF+RTS: 0.020m / UKF+RTS: 0.020m).
   - Yaw estimation improves after smoothing for both EKF and UKF.
   - Pitch shows a minor regression after smoothing for both EKF and UKF, a known trade-off of RTS smoothing.
