===== Key Observations =====
1. EKF vs KF:
   - Longitude error reduced by 80.3% (from 0.245m to 0.048m)
   - Altitude error reduced by 78.1% (from 0.067m to 0.015m)

2. EKF+RTS vs KF:
   - Latitude error reduced by 71.9% (from 0.046m to 0.013m)
   - Longitude error reduced by 91.9% (from 0.245m to 0.020m)
   - Altitude error reduced by 90.2% (from 0.067m to 0.007m)

3. EKF+RTS vs EKF:
   - Latitude error reduced by 71.2% (from 0.045m to 0.013m)
   - Altitude error reduced by 55.1% (from 0.015m to 0.007m)
   - Pitch error increased by 228.7% (from 0.000080° to 0.000263°)

4. Overall Performance Assessment:
   - EKF+RTS achieves centimeter-level accuracy in all position metrics
   - Most significant improvement observed in longitude error (KF: 0.245m → EKF+RTS: 0.020m)
   - Yaw estimation shows consistent improvement through algorithmic enhancements
   - Pitch metric shows minor regression in EKF+RTS due to smoothing trade-offs
